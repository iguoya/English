# Private Cars



With the improvement of living conditions, Some ordinary Chinese families can afford a car. Yet ideas of the development of a private car vary from person to person.

Some claim that there are many advantages to possessing a car. It gives a much greater degree of comfort, freedom, and mobility.

However, others strongly object to developing private cars. They think that as more and more cars are produced and run in the street. there will be more and more waster gas.

the advantages gained in comfort and freedom are often cancelled out by traffic jams. Wether private car should be developed in China is a different      
question to answer.

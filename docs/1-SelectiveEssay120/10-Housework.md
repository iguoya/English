# We Should Learn to Do the housework



Housework is too much for our parents, expectably for our mothers.

Although we are very busy working at our lessons.we should help parents do some housework. because our parents are also busy and tired after a day's work.

They care for us and we should care for them too



**What's more,  doing housework can also help us learn to be independent and make us relax.**

In many students' eyes, housework is tiring and it is adults's work, expecially mothers'.



We should learn to share it because we are also members of family.
